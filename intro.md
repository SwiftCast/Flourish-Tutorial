## What is Flourish?

### Flourish is full, design to deployment app tutorial

Flourish is a mood journal app. More importantly, learning to build Flourish is
the best way to get started learning app development because we think the best
way to get a broad understanding of what it takes to develop an app is to go 
through an entire app tutorial using various frameworks and techniques. We believe
that it can be difficult to learn to build apps by reading about specific classes
or frameworks and would rather get on building a whole app and seeking out deep
dives if you're still curious. 

### You'll learn

* Location Services
* Auto Layout
* CloudKit
* Encryption
* Animation
* Unit Testing 

### Constantly Updating

We want this to be comprehensive and thorough, while being incredibly easy for
beginners to go through. If you think something can be made better or is unclear,
please comment and we will be happy to revise this tutorial over time. 

### Under Construction

This tutorial is a massive undertaking for just three guys and isn't yet complete.
We promise to work on it daily to get it out as soon as we can. In the meantime, 
enjoy a discount on purchasing the entire tutorial while it is still in progress.
